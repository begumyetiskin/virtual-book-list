# Virtual Book List

* I made a virtual book list project by connecting to the PostgreSql database with the Spring Boot backend and working with React on the frontend.

* You can use this application to take notes on the books you want to read or to list the books you have read.

### Requirements

```
Intellij IDEA, VS Code etc. Ide
NodeJs,
PostgreSql

### Installing

When the necessary libraries are installed, you can run them with the command `npm start` from the command line.
The browser will run `localhost: 8081`.
